# bones
---

This program figures out where Sherlock Holmes can bury 8 bones of length 6 for
his dog in a 15x12 grid.  Bones can face either vertical or horizontal.  The way
bones are represented on the grid is by changing a "." to a "B" with for loops,
so by sequentially replacing these characters bones can be "drawn" four different
ways.
